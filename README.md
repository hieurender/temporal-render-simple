# temporal-render-simple

Example repo to show how to deploy a simple version of Temporal to Render.com - using the [Auto-Setup Docker image](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup). This is not recommended for production beyond small usecases, as all 4 Temporal internal services (Frontend, Matching, History, and Worker) are being run out of one process, but the benefit is that setup is also a lot easier.

### One Click

Use the button below to deploy Temporal on Render.
